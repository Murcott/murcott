Imperial Kitchen, Miao Man Xi.<br></br>
　　
Lin Wu Niao was one of Lin Family’s three candidates, naturally she stands in the front row.<br></br>

A layer of curtains separated the judge and the contestants, Lin Wu Niao stood on the tip of her toes, but was still unable to see clearly the situation inside.<br></br>
　
“Everyone don’t be nervous, the competition today, is nothing else but basic skills, you only need to demonstrate what you have learned in your everyday (apprentice) life, it is not necessarily to think too much about other matters.” From behind the cloth curtains, came through a refined and elegant voice, although it was frosty, it still had an exception magnetism.<br></br>
　　
Lin Wu Niao’s felt as if there was a cat scratching her heart, she squatted down and from down there looked towards the inside of the drapes. Apart from the long light blue changpao that nearly touched the ground and the black-clad boots with silver edging,  she was unable to find anything.<br></br>
　　
“Nobleman Li, is it possible to get started?”<br></br>
　
“Yes, let’s start.” Nobleman Li (lips) touched the cup, his mouth sipped a bit: “If I brought my house’s big cat, then there would also be a foot-warmer.”<br></br>
　　
Miao Man Xi slightly leaned his head over, on the surface remaining calm and collected with not a word or movement, yet his voice was cold enough to freeze: “I recommend that Nobleman (Li) keep his door closed, you should admire your big cat by yourself, after all not everyone would appreciate such brutal pets.”<br></br>
　　
Nobleman Li face started to slightly flush with embarrassment, just as he was about to open his mouth to retort, he was interrupted by Miao Man Xi, “Fine, the competition this time will not have a subject, everyone can choose the dish they are most proficient at, there is only one condition, the food that they make, they must also contain their own feelings in it.”<br></br>

To put it briefly, in a sentence, the chef must put their emotion into their dish.<br></br>

“!@#$, it is too non-mainstream, too post-modern.” After Lin Wu Niao finished listening to this sentence, she was completely bowled over by Sir Examiner’s topic, she doesn’t have any knowledge anyways, therefore, today,  she just brought two packs of instant noodles, planning to stew noodles in the courtyard, while also adding a poached egg.<br></br>
　
Having heard the examiner’s requirement, in the blink of an eye she, again made an enormous decision, that is, to add some hot peppers onto the instant noodles.<br></br>

Symbolizing her own circumstances of suffering in an abyss of deep waters and scorching fires.<br></br>

The competition begins, immediately the courtyard buzzes with activity, rolls sleeves up, toss the iron pot, because of nervousness, there was a frequent scene of eggs, fish, and meat flying around everywhere.<br></br>

At the very least Lin Wu Niao had been surprise-attacked by that newbie in the back N times.<br></br>

At this moment on top of her head lay an oily and greasy poached egg, one half-cooked fish, in addition to burnt and crisp bits of green onion and garlic. The more nervous that contestant in the back was, the more the things he was tossing flew out of the pan.<br></br>

“Brother, did you come in through some unwritten rules, how is it that you are (only) cooking a dish yet unexpectedly your ingredients can still be flying everywhere?” Lin Wu Niao was furious, brushed off the fish and egg on her head, and smoothly threw it into her own noodle soup. tln: you can’t even cook a simple dish without the ingredients flying everywhere.<br></br>

OK, she was able to save this fish and chicken egg.<br></br>
