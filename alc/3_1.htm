PART3 The Prelude to Entering the Palace<br></br>

“What is this you have here?”<br></br>

When Lin Wu Niao carried the bowl of noodles to the judges, Miao Man Xi nevertheless gave that bowl of bizarre color and fragrance a stir.<br></br>

“This is the state of my heart, Raging Fire.” Lin Wu Niao very seriously answered him, her eyes churning around and around.<br></br>

Bright and translucent black, just like a pair of first-rate crystals, penetrate with ingeniousness.<br></br>

Miao Man Xi looked at her weird and bizarre appearance, can’t help but smile in his heart as he lowered his head, and lightly ate a bite of noodle soup, concealing the faintly raised corner of his lip.<br></br>

In the midst of the soup’s freshness carried a spiciness, paired with the fiery temperature, it indeed made people shake.<br></br>

“What ingredient is this.” He pursed his eyebrow, and slightly tilted his head as he looked at Lin Wu Niao, “This type of flavor is considerably unique, however, it appears that its freshness is somewhat excessive, after tasting it again, one will think it dull.”<br></br>

Hey bro, this is fast food, you still want to taste it again? Lin Wu Niao raged, bit her lip, said: “This that I have here is Lin Family’s unpassable (secret) law, if you want to learn it, there is actually one way.”<br></br>

Miao Man Xi raised his eyebrow, within his clear limpid eyes devoid of a (single) ripple aroused a thread of interest.<br></br>

Lin Wu Niao flicked her finger, indicating to him to come closer, he actually obediently leaned his ear near her.<br></br>

“You can consider marrying into our Lin Family, at that time whatever you want to learn you can learn however you want, hehehe.” Her lips faintly brushed past his earlobe, following which she rapidly straightened her back, and looked at him very naughtily.<br></br>

All of a sudden Miao Man Xi’s face spread a faint pink, froze his face and straightened his waist. Unfortunately Nobleman Li was fairly indiscreet, interrupting them to ask: “Ah, what private words are you guys discussing, this Mister also wants to listen in.”<br></br>

Lin Wu Niao started at Miao Man Xi with big eyes, Miao Man Xi reddened a bit more from her gaze, raised his hands up, made an appearance of coughing: “Fine, give her the plaque, prepare and get ready, enter the palace together the day after tomorrow.<br></br>

Without this bowl of surging noodle soup, he is also going to do Mister Li a favor.<br></br>

“Oh? To pass this easily, I am unexpectedly born with genius.” Lin Wu Niao was overjoyed, hands danced and feet tripped (to dance and gesticulate for joy), when it withdrew, it was clear that she was not herself, her left foot tripped her right foot, she fell flat on her face at the place of her home (dog ate poop).<br></br>

The corner of Miao Man Xi’s lips was pulled upwards again.<br></br>

He turned his body over, and instructed the record-keeping servant: “This one, assign her to my side, I will personally raise her.” She is truly too unusual, she can only stick to his side, teach her well, only this way can he ensure that there are no blunders.<br></br>

“Sir Miao, this is just right, Lin Family’s recommendations are definitely all quality goods.” Nobleman Li extremely comfortably exhaled a breath of air. In his mind he silently cursed himself, he is just kind and honest to an extreme, he always treats his friends as warmly as spring, look, for the sake of Lin Family Head’s darling third child, he was even willing to put on a thick skin and paste himself on First Chef Miao’s butt.<br></br>

He was really just sulking, but unexpectedly allowed a cook to take advantage of him (to gain the superior position).<br></br>

Miao Man Xi still had that appearance of a mild cloud and light wind (tln: neutral and apathetic), pat his gown, and nodded his head towards him (Nobleman Li): “Nobleman Li has worried.”<br></br>

The selection was approaching its end, he really doesn’t want to face the Nobleman Li who has put on a fake smile.<br></br>

He simply chose some people early on, and planned to leave.<br></br>

“Sir Miao, that’s right, Fourth Prince wanted me to ask you something, for the Autumn Hunt are you willing follow the Fourth Prince’s group to play a bit?”<br></br>

Miao Man Xi’s eyes narrowed, following which he quickly laughed: “Man Xi is only a cook, as far as hunting is concerned, I truly don’t understand a word (doesn’t enter even a single aperture of one’s head), therefore I will have to trouble Nobleman Li to explain for me.”<br></br>

He really does not know how to appreciate favors, Nobleman Li’s mouth cast downwards, with a gulp he drank it (teacup) clean, and with a swing of his sleeve, he turned his body and left.<br></br>

Speaking of which, he still needs to go back to take his big cat for a walk, ne.</br><br></br>
