PART4.1 Finally Sneaked Into The Palace UNEDITED<br></br>
<p>Ten bundles of firewood, thick powder that was spread all over her face and twenty buns of fake hair that stood tall and straight, reaching through the clouds. In addition, two lumps of pure red rouge, high and round, were matched with a peach pink gauze skirt and green jade feather lined jacket&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Miao Manlou moved forward to open the door with an expressionless face and looked into the eyes of a certain person at the doorway. A moment later, with a tremble of his hand, he continued to slam open the door with an expressionless face, knees trembling together with the knees of the servant who supported him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-young Master, what is that thing? It can't be a nine-headed monster!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Man Xi glanced with his clear and cold eyes. His eyebrows wrinkled, he pursed his mouth, and inwardly took a deep breath several times. Once again, he pulled open the main doors with a cold face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I came to offer a humble apology!&rdquo; As soon as she opened her mouth to start talking, powder fell down with a rustling sound.</p>
<p>Miao Man Xi choked on a mouthful of spit. He secretly heaved a sigh of relief, his cold sweat miraculously coming to a halt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to come, go back.&rdquo; His voice was cold and icy, and his legs and feet were still a bit unsteady.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahhh! You want to disqualify me?&rdquo; Lin Wu Niao suddenly wailed with great sorrow. If she were disqualified, she would have to pack her bags and suffer from hunger with that fat elder sister Tang Xin. They would have nothing to eat or drink but the cold northwest wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, look, I&rsquo;ve even come bearing ten bundles of firewood to apologize. Isn't this enough?&rdquo; She excitedly dragged Miao Man Xi&rsquo;s hand towards herself.</p>
<p>Her dress and makeup were a hideous mess, but her eyes continued to shine just as brightly and clearly as before. It glittered and dazzled, and Miao Man Xi couldn't help turning his face away. Just as his hand was about to make contact with her back, he stated with his face dyed in a faint layer of pink, &ldquo;Miss Lin, men and women should not touch hands when they give or receive things! Please conduct yourself with dignity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ptui! You filthy bastard, I was letting you touch the firewood, just where did your thoughts go?!&rdquo; Lin Wu Niao was furious, turned her body, allowing him to see the firewood her back was burdened with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this enough sincerity or not ah? If it isn&rsquo;t enough I&rsquo;ll carry another ten bundles for you!&rdquo; Her eyes brimmed with tears as she stared at Miao Manxi.</p>
<p>Miao Man Xi gave her a bout of rebuke, his cold and handsome face, suddenly blushed, previously he was always proud and aloof, previously he always had a cold and cheerless expression on his face, if not ice then frost, to blush red like this, as a matter of fact is the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s not enough?&rdquo; She saw that he only blushed, not declaring his position (on the matter), and finally began to worry, &ldquo;I @#$%! your @#$%! Everything I okayed you shot down, are you extorting me? You thought that Kang X instant noodles is Sanlu powdered milk, if you eat it you will have a kidney stone ah, in that case Cow B&rsquo;s stuff, still is not popular ne, naturally you have a young master&rsquo;s digestive system ah, drinking a little bit of noodle broth, will you vomit until you&rsquo;re all dried out, did you think that you were drinking laxative tea (to lose weight)&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more she said the angrier she became, ever since she time traveled she had been holding back her worries and grievances, she finally erupted, and punched him in the eye, &ldquo;Are you a man or not, letting a weak and delicate woman haul firewood back and forth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; The black in the middle of Miao Man Xi&rsquo;s face carried greenness, somewhat carrying a few helpless feelings.&nbsp;<em>(In Chinese opera, actors wear black and green face make-up to indicate anger and helpless or bad luck.)</em></p>
<p>If she counted as a weak and delicate female, then there definitely wasn&rsquo;t a woman who could take second place as the strongest in the world.</p>
<p>She is more like a man than he is, unexpectedly even boasted shamelessly to flaunt herself as a weak and delicate woman!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, if you cancel my qualifications, then my mother and I will certainly be kicked out of the door, anyway it&rsquo;s all a matter of sooner or later, I also don&rsquo;t care! You &lsquo;re responsible, you&rsquo;re responsible!&rdquo; She suddenly burst into tears, threw off the firewood on her back, and in a fit of pique, plopped her bottom down at the threshold of Miao Man Family&rsquo;s main entrance.</p>
<p>Simultaneously crying while wiping her tears, that lump of powder kneaded into a round ball, she wiped left and right but was unable to rub it off, she reached out with her hand wanting to use her sleeve to wipe it off, suddenly thought of third elder sister who she borrowed the clothes from, and promptly put down the sleeve embarrassedly, grabbed Miao Man Xi&rsquo;s changpao and pulled it over, wiping until the wind blows over the water&rsquo;s surface, and the water surges with great billows (to do things with anger, vigorously and thrivingly).</p>
<p>Miao Man Xi&rsquo;s eyes shut and shut again, his closed fist kneaded and kneaded again, at last he could not bear it and pulled back the corner of his gown, raging, &ldquo;Lin Wu Niao, you have nothing other than yourself (<em>you&rsquo;re as poor as dirt</em>), I gave you a way out (<em>gave you a horse and let you go</em>), preventing you from going into the Imperial Palace and making mistakes, why are you so obstinately going about things the wrong way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eye fell on that lump of peerlessly greasy white ball of powder on the corner of his gown, and he had a good, long spell of nausea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said I don&rsquo;t own anything other than myself, who said that!&rdquo; She sobbed, stood up, and reached out her hand to point at his chest, jabbed it very hard, one time and another time, Miao Man Xi let her jab with her face flushed red from anger.</p>
<p>He might as well (<em>simply</em>) envelop her little hand in his: &ldquo;Miss Lin, if you continue to act like this, then I will close the door and see you out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Act like what?&rdquo; Lin Wu Niao opened her eyes wide to glare at him face to face, &ldquo;Brother, right now it is you who is harassing me, all right?&rdquo; She pulled back her hand, Miao Man Xi suddenly came to himself (<em>woke up to reality</em>), incomparably awkward.</p>
<p>He flew into a rage out of humiliation and released his hand, flung his sleeves, &ldquo;Since you obstinately persist in going about things the wrong way, I am also not going to waste my time to lowering myself, if you must enter the Imperial Palace, then just go ahead and enter.&rdquo;</p>
