PART4.1 Finally Sneaked Into The Palace UNEDITED<br></br>
<p>Ten bundles of firewood, thick layers of powder smeared on her face, and twenty buns of fake hair towering high, almost touching the clouds. In addition, two round and vibrant red cheeks were paired with a peach pink-gauze skirt and a green jade feather lined-jacket&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Miao Manlou moved forward to open the door, his face expressionless, as he locked eyes with a certain person standing at the doorway. After a moment, he continued to push open the door with a trembling hand, his face still devoid of emotion as his knees shaking alongisde the servant supporting him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-young Master, what is that thing? Could it be a nine-headed monster!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manxi's clear, cold eyes darted a glance. He furrowed his eyebrows, pursed his lips, and took a few deep breaths inwardly. With a cold expression, he swung the main doors open once again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I've come to offer a humble apology!&rdquo; As soon as she opened her mouth to speak, powder fell down with a light rustling sound.</p>
<p>Miao Manxi choked on a mouthful of saliva. He secretly heaved a sigh of relief, his cold sweat miraculously coming to a halt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t have come. Go back.&rdquo; His voice was icy, and his legs and feet were still a bit unsteady.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahhh! Are you going to disqualify me?&rdquo; Lin Wuniao suddenly wailed in sorrow. If she were disqualified, she and that fat elder sister Tang Xin would be thrown out onto the streets, with nothing to eat or drink but the cold northwest wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, look, I&rsquo;ve even brought ten bundles of firewood as an apology. Isn't this enough?&rdquo; She excitedly reached out and started dragging Miao Manxi&rsquo;s hand towards her back</p>
<p>Her dress and makeup were a hideous mess, but her eyes continued to shine just as brightly and clearly as before, dazzling and capitvating. Miao Manxi couldn't help but turn his face away. Just as his hand was about to touch her, his face blushed in a faint layer of pink and he said, &ldquo;Miss Lin, men and women should not touch hands when exchanging items! Please maintain your dignity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ptui! You dirty-minded jerk! I was letting you touch the firewood, just where did your thoughts go?!&rdquo; Lin Wuniao was furious. She turned around to let him to see the firewood burdening her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this enough sincerity or not?! If it&rsquo;s not, I&rsquo;ll carry ten more bundles for you!&rdquo; She stared at Miao Manxi with tearful eyes.</p>
<p>Miao Manxi scolded her lightly, a faint blush suddenly spreading across his cold and handsome face. He had always been proud and aloof, bearing a cold and cheerless expression on his face. If his face weren't icy, then it was frosty For him to blush red like this was indeed a first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s not enough?&rdquo; She saw that he only blushed, not declaring his position (on the matter), and finally began to worry, &ldquo;I @#$%! your @#$%! Everything I okayed you shot down, are you extorting me? You thought that Kang X instant noodles is Sanlu powdered milk, if you eat it you will have a kidney stone ah, in that case Cow B&rsquo;s stuff, still is not popular ne, naturally you have a young master&rsquo;s digestive system ah, drinking a little bit of noodle broth, will you vomit until you&rsquo;re all dried out, did you think that you were drinking laxative tea (to lose weight)&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more she said the angrier she became, ever since she time traveled she had been holding back her worries and grievances, she finally erupted, and punched him in the eye, &ldquo;Are you a man or not, letting a weak and delicate woman haul firewood back and forth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; The black in the middle of Miao Manxi&rsquo;s face carried greenness, somewhat carrying a few helpless feelings.&nbsp;<em>(In Chinese opera, actors wear black and green face make-up to indicate anger and helpless or bad luck.)</em></p>
<p>If she counted as a weak and delicate female, then there definitely wasn&rsquo;t a woman who could take second place as the strongest in the world.</p>
<p>She is more like a man than he is, unexpectedly even boasted shamelessly to flaunt herself as a weak and delicate woman!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, if you cancel my qualifications, then my mother and I will certainly be kicked out of the door, anyway it&rsquo;s all a matter of sooner or later, I also don&rsquo;t care! You &lsquo;re responsible, you&rsquo;re responsible!&rdquo; She suddenly burst into tears, threw off the firewood on her back, and in a fit of pique, plopped her bottom down at the threshold of Miao Man Family&rsquo;s main entrance.</p>
<p>Simultaneously crying while wiping her tears, that lump of powder kneaded into a round ball, she wiped left and right but was unable to rub it off, she reached out with her hand wanting to use her sleeve to wipe it off, suddenly thought of third elder sister who she borrowed the clothes from, and promptly put down the sleeve embarrassedly, grabbed Miao Manxi&rsquo;s changpao and pulled it over, wiping until the wind blows over the water&rsquo;s surface, and the water surges with great billows (to do things with anger, vigorously and thrivingly).</p>
<p>Miao Manxi&rsquo;s eyes shut and shut again, his closed fist kneaded and kneaded again, at last he could not bear it and pulled back the corner of his gown, raging, &ldquo;Lin Wuniao, you have nothing other than yourself (<em>you&rsquo;re as poor as dirt</em>), I gave you a way out (<em>gave you a horse and let you go</em>), preventing you from going into the Imperial Palace and making mistakes, why are you so obstinately going about things the wrong way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eye fell on that lump of peerlessly greasy white ball of powder on the corner of his gown, and he had a good, long spell of nausea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said I don&rsquo;t own anything other than myself, who said that!&rdquo; She sobbed, stood up, and reached out her hand to point at his chest, jabbed it very hard, one time and another time, Miao Manxi let her jab with her face flushed red from anger.</p>
<p>He might as well (<em>simply</em>) envelop her little hand in his: &ldquo;Miss Lin, if you continue to act like this, then I will close the door and see you out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Act like what?&rdquo; Lin Wuniao opened her eyes wide to glare at him face to face, &ldquo;Brother, right now it is you who is harassing me, all right?&rdquo; She pulled back her hand, Miao Manxi suddenly came to himself (<em>woke up to reality</em>), incomparably awkward.</p>
<p>He flew into a rage out of humiliation and released his hand, flung his sleeves, &ldquo;Since you obstinately persist in going about things the wrong way, I am also not going to waste my time to lowering myself, if you must enter the Imperial Palace, then just go ahead and enter.&rdquo;</p>
